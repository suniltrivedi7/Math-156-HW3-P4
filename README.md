# README: Logistic Regression with Mini-Batch SGD

## Project Overview
This project implements a binary logistic regression model using mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for classification on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Installation
To run this project, install the required libraries using:
```
pip install numpy scikit-learn
```

## Usage
Run the script to train the logistic regression model and evaluate its performance:
```
python Math-156-HW3-P4.py
```
